# 181117 TIL Note 
- React + TS Study
  - Advantages
    - No need to use propTypes library
  - Components
    - Component Classes
      - Mark this quote about classes
        > " A class has a special type, which is separate from the type of instance of a class. It is defined in terms of a constructor function."
      - A type of a constructor function that returns an object which is an instance of a Component.
        ```typescript
        interface ComponentClass<P = {}> {
          new (props: P, context?: any): Component<P, ComponentState>;
        }
        ```
    - Stateless Functional Components (SFC)
      - A function that takes a properties object, optional list of children components, and optional context object. It returns either a `ReactElement` or `null`
        ```typescript
          interface StatelessComponent<P = {}> {
            (props: P & { children?: ReactNode }, context?: any): ReactElement<any> | null;
          }
          type SFC<P = {}> = StatelessComponent<P>;
        ```
    - Pure/Non-pure Components
      - `PureComponent` has a default implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate` function
      - Shallow compare between `this.props` and `this.state`, not updated everytime, only when props !== state
      - Common misconception : a `StatelessComponent` is not pure, and a `PureComponent` may have a state.
      - Stateful Components should be derived from `React.PureComponent`
        1. The setState function uses a callback to update state based on the previous state as per the React documentation.
        2. We derive from React.PureComponent because it does not override the lifecycle functions
        3. The State type is defined as a class so that it can have an initializer.
        4. We don’t assign properties to local variables in the render function as it violates the DRY principle, and adds unnecessary lines of code.
        
    - Higher Order Components (HOC)
      - A Function that takes a component definition and returns a new component definition
        ```typescript
        const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
        ```
      - Returns either `ComponentClass` or `StatelessComponent`
      - Why do we need this? 
        - When components do basically same work, we need abstraction... right?
      - Rather, a HOC composes the original component by wrapping it in a container component. 
      - HOC is a pure function with zero side-effects.
      - Instead of mutation, HOCs should use composition, by wrapping the input component in a container component
      - Conventions
        - Pass Unrelated Props Through to the Wrapped Component
        - Maximizing Composability
        - Wrap the Display Name for Easy Debugging
      - Caveats
        - Don’t Use HOCs Inside the render Method
        - Static Methods Must Be Copied Over
        - Refs Aren’t Passed Through
      - Inner, Outer, Injected Properties
        - Outer: Added by HOC, Inner: Original properties, Injected: Difference between inner and outer
        - Use typescript intersection functions
          ```typescript
            interface LabelProp {
              label: string;
            }
            interface ValueProp {
              value: number;
            }
            // Has both a label field and a value field
            type LabeledValueProp = LabelProp & ValueProp;
          ```
