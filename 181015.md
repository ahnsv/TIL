Canary Testing
- Canary Tests are minimal tests to quickly and automatically verify that the everything you depend on is ready. 
- You run Canary tests before other time-consuming tests, and before wasting time investigating in your code when the other tests are red. 
- If the canary test fails, you know you have to fix something on the environments first.
Blue/Green Deployment
- Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical environments running different versions of the application.
- At any time, only one of the environments is live, with the live environment serving all production traffic.
