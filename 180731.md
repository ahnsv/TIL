Go lang Concurrency
Making progress on more than one task simultaneously 
- To make it simultaneous, add some delay
- channel direction in parameters
  - specify if it is sender or receiver
- A buffered channel is async, sending/receiving a message will not wait unless the channel is already full

Concurrency patterns
- Fan-in : Multiple channels -> single channel (multiplexing)
- Fan-out/Workers : Single Channel -> Multiple channels
- Servers
