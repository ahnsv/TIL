* Concepts and Terminologies
    * LL Parser or LL(k)
        : A topdown parser for a subset of context-free language, **Left -> Right**
        k is tokens of lookahead (need to work on more... too hard)
    * Context-Free Grammars (CFG)
        : consist of a set of terminals, a set of non-terminals, a start symbol, and a set of productions
        * a set of terminal symbols, which are the characters of the alphabet that appear in the strings generated by the grammar.
        * a set of nonterminal symbols, which are placeholders for patterns of terminal symbols that can be generated by the nonterminal symbols.
        * a set of productions, which are rules for replacing (or rewriting) nonterminal symbols (on the left side of the production) in a string with other nonterminal or terminal symbols (on the right side of the production).
        * a start symbol, which is a special nonterminal symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar.
